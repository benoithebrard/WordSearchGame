# WordSearchGame
The userâ€™s task is to find all the translations in the grid.

The user selects a word by pressing down on a letter in the grid, dragging to another letter in the
grid, and then releasing their finger. If the selected word is a valid translation of the source word,
it stays highlighted. Otherwise, the selection disappears. After all the targets have
been found, the app displays a new grid and a new source word.
